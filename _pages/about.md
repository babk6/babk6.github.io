I am a physical chemist working at the [Chemistry Lab](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/CHIMIE) of the [École Normale Supérieure de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr). My research lies at the interface between materials science, soft-matter and nanotechnology. I study the self-assembly of nanocrystals in the perspective of the emergence of collective properties. This implies understanding colloidal forces between particles at the nanoscale. I am also interested in probing the formation mechanism of nanoparticles using in situ synchrotron based X-ray techniques. Since 2010, i have mainly been working on semi-conducting nanoparticles (quantum dots), with a particular interest in CdSe nanoplatelets.
